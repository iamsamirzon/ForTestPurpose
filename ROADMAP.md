# Roadmap
## Process and Tools
The Notary V2 team uses the [Roadmap GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/notaryproject/projects/2) to track short term (1-3 months) and medium term (3-6 months) efforts and long term (6-12 months). Once a broad objective (from the "Research & Scoping" column) is further scoped into a GitHub issue that has a clear objective, background and motive, it is moved into the "Backlog" column. From there, the team plans releases via [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/milestones).

## Current and Future Objectives
At this time, the NotaryV2 community is working on two separate sub projects, TUF and Notation. This roadmap is focussed on the Notation aspect

### Current (Short term) Focus
- Putting Alpha Release(s) out of Notation for early feedback and testing.
- Iterate on the Notary V2 specfication for the first GA Release
- Collaborate with other open source projects for co-related/depdendent features needed for end to end use case of OCI artifacts signing

### Future (Mid to Long term) Focus
- Release the first [GA version of the Notary V2 Specfication and Notation Client](https://github.com/iamsamirzon/ForTestPurpose/projects/1)
- Iterate on supporting additonal signature formats in the specfication
- Support Revocation in the Notation Client
