# Roadmap
## Process and Tools
The Notatary V2 team uses the [Roadmap GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/projects/3) to track short term (1-3 months) and medium term (3-6 months) efforts. Once a broad objective (from the "Research & Scoping" column) is further scoped into a GitHub issue that has a clear objective, background and motive, it is moved into the "Planned & Scoped" column. From there, the team plans monthly releases via [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/milestones).

## Current and Future Objectives
At this time, the NotaryV2 community is working on two separate sub projects, TUF and Notation. This roadmap is focussed on Notation's roadmap for container image signing 

### Current
- Putting an Alpha Release out of Notation for early feedback and testing
- Finish the Notary V2 specfication for the first GA Release
- Collaborate with other open source projects for co-related/depdendent features needed for end to end use case

### Future
In the medium to long term future, the community will tackle the following:
- Release the first GA version of the Notary V2 Specfication
- Release the first GA version of the Notation Client
- Iterate on supporting additonal signature formats in the specfication
- Support Revocation in the Notation Client
