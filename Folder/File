## List of feature/capabilties added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation and Notation-go-lib) users can refer to the individual release notes. In this document a summary view will be provided.

### Notary V2 standard
The standard is still in draft state and changes are expected to happen in subsequent releases around signture format, revocation, and integration with external PKI and signing services.

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone client and is not integrated with Docker or Containerd client. It uses a fixed configuration scheme in this release, where the certificates for signing and verifiying are kept in a file. Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md. It supports the operations for sign and verify. 

To start using Notation Refer : https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library
Written in the GO language the Library is currently focussed on enabling the Notation CLI.

## List of fixed issues
Not Applicable. This is the first release of the NotaryV2

## List of known/open issues
1. Does not support working with an external registry located on a different host. Use a localhost registry for this release.
2. The passwords are stored in clear text.
3. An image must be present in the registry before it can be signed. 

### Backwards Comatabilty
While there is not a prior release, but this release is unlikely to be compataible with the next release, and hence it should not be used in a production envoirnment.
